It stands to reason that if vehicles can follow one another more closely, as CACC allows, then capacity will increase. However, none of the papers is definitive and there have been no documented field tests to quantify the potential impacts of CACC.  In conclusion, at low market penetration rates CAVs appear to have no significant impact on capacity of the roads since platooning would be challenging due to the low number of CAVs.

Outcomes were found to vary, however, depending on the policy relating to utilization of the dedicated CACC lanes (i.e. whether usage by CACC vehicles was optional or mandatory).
